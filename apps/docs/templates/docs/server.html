    <h1>Servers!</h1>

    Hello, my name is James Long. If you aren't me, how did you find
    this page? You tricky bastard you. Here is the beginnings of
    documentation for my server setup. This is really helpful to have
    so I'm trying to document it fully. Other people might be
    interested in this too.

    <h1>What servers?</h1>
        
    What do I use servers for? I consider them a playground for new
    ideas. It helps with that whole innovation thing. Also, I think
    it's really important for programmers to know this stuff.

    Right now, I host a few websites with my servers
    (<a href="http://jongster.com/">http://jlongster.com/</a>). I
    intend to play around with EC2 and cloud computing at some
    point. There are lots of interesting applications with machine
    learning, multiplayer games, and more. Whatever peaks my interest.

    <h1>Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Building out a new server</h2>
    
    I use <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/radmind/">Radmind</a>
    to manage files on my servers. To get a new server up and running:

    <ol>
      <li>Install <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></li>
      <li>Install <a href="http://jlongster.com/s/radmind-1.14.1.tar.gz">Radmind client (download)</a></li>
      <li>
        I have a Radmind server running in my VirtualBox Arch Linux
        instance. Boot it up, add server's IP to
        <code>/var/radmind/config</code>. Create ssh tunnel to new server. (TODO:
        Need to move Radmind server to public server to avoid ssh
        tunnel which hides real IP address)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new Radmind command file, if not re-using a previous
        one (you can customize which packages are installed)
      </li>
      <li>
        On new server, download Radmin transcripts with the command:<br /><br />

        <code>ktcheck -c sha1 -h localhost</code><br /><br />

        (localhost because of ssh tunnel)
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply the transcripts:<br /><br />

        <code>fsdiff -A -c sha1 / | lapply -h localhost</code>
      </li>
      <li>The server filesystem now matches the one described in the command file.</li>
      <li>
        Localize the server however you please:

        <ul>
          <li>Run <code>localize &lt;hostname&gt;</code> to set the host name</li>
          <li>Edit <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to configure network, daemons, and other settings</li>
          <li>
            Add custom code to run at boot
            in <code>/etc/rc.local</code>. If you will be
            using <code>runit</code>, add the following line:<br /><br />

            <code>/sbin/runsvdir-start & > /dev/null</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If using <code>runit</code>, check out the <code>/services</code> directory:<br /><br />
        
        <code>sudo git clone ssh://james@linode/git/services.git /services</code><br /><br />

        This repo simply has a list of submodules representing
        available services. Various web servers and things are
        included. Simply checkout the submodule and <code>runit</code>
        will automatically start running the service.

        If you wish to track the <code>/service</code> directory for
        this particular machine, create a new branch with a meaningful
        name. Otherwise, you can delete the <code>.git</code> or do
        whatever you like from here.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you wish to customize a service, create a new branch. If
        it's a server-specific customization, name the branch after
        the hostname. If not, give it a meaningful name representing
        the reason for customizing.
      </li>

      <li>
        Another git repo available includes all my websites as submodules. If interested, clone it:<br /><br />

        <code>sudo git clone ssh://james@linode/git/sites.git /sites</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Updating/creating transcripts</h2>
    
    <p>
      Right now, I only have 1 transcript because I only have 1
      server. As I get a better feeling for how I should split up the
      transcripts into modules, I will do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have applied this transcript on my linode server and my local
      Arch Linux installation, so I have an exact copy of my server
      running locally. I test updates to my server locally, update the
      Radming transcript, and deploy changes through Radmind.
    </p>

    <h3>Creating a new base transcript</h3>
    
    There's also something called a <em>negative</em> transcript,
    which are files Radmind should ignore. You almost always need to
    recreate this also if you are creating a new base transcript, so
    I'm including that in the following instructions.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Assume that you want to replace the base
        transcript <code>jlongster.T</code> and negative transcript <code>negative.T</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the current transcript (if it exists) to start fresh:<br /><br />

        <code>sudo rm /var/radmind/client/jlongster.T</code>
      <li>
        Create the new transcript by running:<br /><br />

        <code>fsdiff -C -c sha1 -o /var/radmind/client/jlongster.T /</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload the new transcript and files (assuming Radming server
        running at <code>localhost</code>):<br /><br />

        <code>lcreate -h localhost /var/radmind/client/jlongster.T</code><br />
        <code>lcreate -N -h localhost /var/radmind/client/negative.T</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>On the Radmind server</strong>, verify and publish the
        new transcript and files:<br /><br />

        <code>sudo rm -r /var/radmind/file/jlongster.T</code><br />
        <code>sudo rm /var/radmind/transcript/jlongster.T</code><br /><br />

        <code>cd /var/radmind/tmp/transcript</code><br />
        <code>lcksum -c sha1 -n jlongster.T</code><br />
        <code>lcksum -c sha1 negative.T</code><br />
        <code>mv /var/radmind/tmp/transcript/jlongster.T /var/radmind/transcript</code><br />
        <code>mv /var/radmind/tmp/file/jlongster.T /var/radmind/file</code><br />
        <code>mv /var/radmind/tmp/transcript/negative.T /var/radmind/transcript</code><br />
        <code>mv /var/radmind/tmp/file/negative.T /var/radmind/file</code>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating new additional transcripts (payloads)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Once you have a base transcript, you can create smaller
      transcripts which represent specific additions (this payload
      includes node.js, or emacs functions, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
      I know how to do this, but I'm not documenting it yet because I
      haven't incorporated it in my workflow yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another neat thing you can do is create new base transcripts
      with this method. You create whatever new transcripts you want
      and use the <code>lmerge</code> command to merge them into the
      base transcript. This is a lot faster than the instructions
      above since you won't have to transfer the whole filesystem to
      the Radmind server every time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>TODO</strong>: I really need to adapt this into my
      system, as I will get a lot more out of Radmind this way.
    </p>

    <h3>Transcripts</h3>
    
    <p>The base OS should be Arch Linux 2010.05.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Base</strong>, pacman -S &lt;package&gt;
      <ul>
        <li>zsh</li>
        <li>openssh</li>
        <li>base-devel</li>
        <li>sudo</li>
        <li>emacs</li>
        
      </ul>
    </p>
